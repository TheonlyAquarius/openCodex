To move a file into a different directory in your GitHub repository, follow these steps:

1. **Clone the Repository Locally:**
   If you don't already have the repository on your local machine, clone it using:
   ```bash
   git clone https://github.com/TheonlyAquarius/openCodex.git
   cd openCodex
   ```

2. **Move the File:**
   Use the `mv` command to move the file to the desired directory. For example, to move `config.ts` into a folder called `new-directory`:
   ```bash
   mv config.ts new-directory/
   ```

3. **Stage the Changes:**
   Add the changes to Git using:
   ```bash
   git add .
   ```

4. **Commit the Changes:**
   Commit the changes with a message:
   ```bash
   git commit -m "Moved config.ts to new-directory"
   ```

5. **Push the Changes:**
   Push the changes to the remote repository:
   ```bash
   git push
   ```

If the directory does not exist, you can create it first using `mkdir new-directory`. Let me know if you need help with any of these steps!
